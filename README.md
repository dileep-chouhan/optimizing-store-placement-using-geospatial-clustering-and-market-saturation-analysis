# Optimizing Store Placement Using Geospatial Clustering and Market Saturation Analysis

## Overview

This project analyzes existing store locations and demographic data to identify optimal locations for new stores and assess potential market saturation.  It leverages geospatial clustering techniques to group stores and analyze their spatial distribution, providing insights into areas with high concentration (potential saturation) and areas with gaps in coverage (potential opportunities). The analysis considers factors like population density, competition, and accessibility to inform strategic store placement decisions.

## Technologies Used

* Python 3
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Scikit-learn (for clustering algorithms)
* Geopandas (for geospatial data handling)


## How to Run

1. **Install Dependencies:**  Ensure you have Python 3 installed. Then, install the necessary Python libraries listed above using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Script:** Execute the main script using:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   This will perform the geospatial analysis and generate the output described below.  Note that you might need to adjust file paths within `main.py` to point to your own data files.


## Example Output

The script produces the following outputs:

* **Console Output:**  The script prints key findings to the console, including summaries of cluster analysis,  potential areas of market saturation, and suggested locations for new stores based on identified gaps.

* **Plot Files:**  The analysis generates several plot files (e.g., `cluster_map.png`, `market_saturation_map.png`) visualizing the spatial distribution of stores, clusters, and areas of potential saturation. These plots provide a visual representation of the analysis results.  These files will be saved in the same directory as `main.py`.

## Data Requirements

The project requires input data files containing store locations (latitude and longitude) and relevant demographic information.  The expected format and structure of these data files are detailed within the `data` directory (or specified within the script itself).  You will need to provide your own data files conforming to this structure.
